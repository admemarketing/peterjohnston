At a time when America, Britain, France and Australia are beset with the triple whammy of pandemic, economic recession and racial tensions, it’s worth looking at a young woman who demonstrates effective leadership.

Jacinta Ardern, in less than three years at the helm, has faced all three challenges. Last year, a right-wing extremist invaded mosques in Christchurch, killing 51 Muslims at prayer. Muslims represent 1% of New Zealand’s population and most have migrated there in the past twenty years. To give himself maximum publicity, the assassin broadcast his slaughter on Facebook.

In response, the prime minister donned a hijab, the Muslim headscarf, and stood by her fellow New Zealanders, She deprived the murderer of publicity by refusing to use his name, and encouraged the media to do likewise. She then turned the tragedy into a triumph by pushing through gun reform. No longer can anyone in New Zealand own a semi-automatic military-style weapon, thereby ensuring no more massacres of this kind.

When COVID-19 hit, realising the threat to their health and economy, she closed the borders early. Following the best available scientific advice, she instituted a total lockdown for four weeks, for which she received flak at the time. Later, when it became clear that New Zealand had contained the pandemic better than any other country in the world, a survey showed 90% approval of the lockdown.

As a leader, Jacinta has shown compassion, honesty, courage and competence. She has united her country and earned the trust of New Zealanders. They know they can rely on her to do her best for them. She is showing what I call ‘The Eagle’s Way’.  She is not fighting or avoiding any problems. She is looking at them honestly – but then giving her focus to finding solutions.
